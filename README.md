## Week 2
- I found this video, which I feel it's interesting. It is An Arduino-powered Egg Printer that made from the ELEKS team. This machine can print the digital graphic on the surface of the egg, and it controls the direction of the pen to draw the design figure along the curve of the egg smoothly. You end up with a specially designed egg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fdly5wphA
