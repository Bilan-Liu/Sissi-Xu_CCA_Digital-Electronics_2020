## Week 2
- I found this video, which I feel it's interesting. It is An Arduino-powered Egg Printer that made from the ELEKS team. This machine can print the digital graphic on the surface of the egg, and it controls the direction of the pen to draw the design figure along the curve of the egg smoothly. You end up with a specially designed egg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fdly5wphA

## Week 3
- My concept is to design a 
![Mentos Machine](/images/Mentos.JPG)

- First Step: Sketch out the machine and use cardboard to make a prototype.
- Second Step: Refine the Prototype using better materials.
- Final Step: Refine again to be well accomplished.
- Add on: "Nice to have"

- "Must have"
  - The TCS3200 color sensor. (Sense and recognize the color of the candy)
  - Able to separate colored candies into different container.
  
- "Nice to have"
  - Different colors of led represent different colors of candy.
  - Digital Counter
